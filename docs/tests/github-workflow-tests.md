# GitHub Workflow Tests

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is a placeholder that will be fully completed once all GitHub workflow tests are running and fully passing.

## Overview

This document will contain information about the GitHub workflow-based testing system for the LangGraph Builder Implementation Guide. The implementation plan is detailed in [GitHub Workflows and Dependabot Implementation Plan](../plans/github-workflows-dependabot-plan.md).

## Planned Content

When fully implemented, this documentation will include:

1. **Workflow Configuration**
   - Details of the GitHub Actions workflow setup
   - How tests are triggered (push, PR, manual)
   - Environment configuration

2. **Test Execution**
   - How tests run in the GitHub environment
   - Differences between local and CI/CD test execution
   - Viewing test results in GitHub

3. **Coverage Reports**
   - How coverage reports are generated and stored
   - Interpreting coverage results
   - History and trends

4. **Dependabot Integration**
   - How dependency updates are managed
   - Review process for dependency updates
   - Grouping strategy for related dependencies

## Implementation Status

The GitHub workflow tests implementation is in progress. Once the following milestones are completed, this documentation will be updated:

- [ ] GitHub workflow configuration created
- [ ] Initial test run completed successfully
- [ ] Coverage report generation confirmed
- [ ] Dependabot configuration validated
- [ ] Documentation of processes and best practices

Refer to the [local tests documentation](./local-tests.md) for information about running tests locally in the meantime.
